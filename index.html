  What causes dreams?
</h2>
    <p>
      As to why people dream, This is a timeless inquiry. 

      Researchers still don't fully understand why people dream or where dreams come from. 

      Nonetheless, according to widely accepted ideas, 
      dreaming can aid in the consolidation and analysis of memories 
      (such as habits and skills) and may even act as a "dress rehearsal" 
      for obstacles and scenarios you would experience during the day. 

      A significant portion, but not all, of what occurs biologically 
      in dreams is also known. The majority of dreaming happens during REM sleep, 
      which we cycle through frequently throughout the night. 
      Our brain waves are almost as busy during the REM period as they are when we are awake, 
      according to studies on sleep.

      According to specialists, dreams are thought to be produced by the forebrain 
      and REM sleep by the brainstem. In fact, the patient will dream but won't go into REM sleep 
      if the brainstem is damaged. 
      The patient will go into REM sleep if the forebrain is damaged, but they won't dream. 

      Nonetheless, there is still much to learn about the psychological processes involved in dreams. 
      For instance, one study found that, as opposed to perception, your dreams are more likely to be the result of your imagination 
      (memories, abstract ideas, and wishes that originate from deep inside your brain) 
      (vivid sensory experiences that you collect in your forebrain).
